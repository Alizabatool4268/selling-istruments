# Introduction
Selling Instruments is a dynamic website I developed that represents a major milestone in my web development journey, particularly as it marks the beginning of my exploration with Next.js. This project reflects not only my technical grasp of Next.js fundamentals — including routing, dynamic rendering, and optimized performance — but also showcases my growing enthusiasm for UI and UX design.

For the first time, I incorporated an external UI/UX component library, Acertinity, to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of the site. Integrating this library taught me how to work with pre-built design systems while maintaining my creative touch. I also implemented a variety of animations throughout the website to create a smooth, interactive experience for users.

Another key feature of this project was the introduction of a small-scale product inventory. This allowed me to practice structuring and displaying dynamic data, further refining both my front-end skills and my attention to user-centered design. Overall, Selling Instruments stands as a meaningful project where I combined functionality, design, and interactivity — setting a strong foundation for my future work with Next.js and modern web technologies.
